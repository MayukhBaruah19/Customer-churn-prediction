# Project : Customer Churn Prediction
Customer churn prediction is the process of identifying which customers are likely to stop using a company’s product or service in the near future. In business terms, “churn” refers to when a customer leaves or cancels their subscription, service, or relationship with the company. For example, a telecom company can use churn prediction to identify users likely to cancel their phone plan and target them with personalized retention strategies.<br>
